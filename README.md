# AagingPEPred
Random Classifiers for Predicting Anti-aging Peptides

# About AagingPEPred
AagingPEPred is a machine learning-based tool designed to predict anti-aging peptides. It employs models trained on descriptors that can be calculated from amino acid sequences. The tool is capable of accepting peptide sequences in Fasta format, with lengths ranging from 5 to 50 amino acid residues.
